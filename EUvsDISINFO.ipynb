      "On March 30, 2022, the Russian army left Bucha, 30 km from Kiev. The following day, Ukrainian forces, including fighters from the Nationalist Azov Battalion, entered the town. It was not until the fifth day after the Russian troops had withdrawn that dozens of Western journalists entered the town. Images were quickly broadcast on TV, showing what would later be called the Bucha massacre. [...] we can see that they coordinated their work with Western supervisors, because everyone says “Oh, there are corpses everywhere, it's a massacre\" [...].\n",
      "\n",
      "One understands who was responsible for these crimes, it was the Ukrainian death squads. All Western media were brandishing satellite photos showing several bodies, saying “Look, corpses lying on the road.” But who knows where they came from? No proof, no investigation. Who's to blame? Russia, of course!\n",
      "\n",
      "Joseph Goebbels once said, “A lie repeated a thousand times becomes the truth”. It's his most famous aphorism. In fact, this principle still works and is still used, including by the Ukrainian Centre for Psychological and Media operations.\n"
